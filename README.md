This is a MATLAB program for quadrotor UAV control using the geometric tracking controller proposed by Taeyoung Lee, Melvin Leok, and N. Harris McClamroch in their work  "Geometric Tracking Control of a Quadrotor UAV on SE(3)". If you want to see more details of the derivations, please refer to http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2010.5717652.

The usage of this program is very simple. 
1. Clone all the m files into your path.
2. Run the test.m file.
3. Wait for seconds, and you can see the results of the simulation.

The cases included in the program are from the original paper of Taeyoung Lee, etc.
